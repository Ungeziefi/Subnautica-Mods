- Fixed unused lava geyser particles spawning on every game load.
- Creatures always flee to the origin coordinates when attacked.

Notes from Discord:
- Everything flees to 0/0/0 instead of away from you or the leash point or whatever else the intention was.
- Sometimes scrolling in the databank is incredibly unresponsive.
- Random chance via LootDistribution
- When you select a different entry in databank it would be scrolled down to the spot you had on the previous entry instead of starting at the top.
