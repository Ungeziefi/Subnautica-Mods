All features have extensive configuration options and should be compatible with everything.

### Camera Zoom
- **Cyclops camera zoom**.
- **Player camera zoom**.

### Custom Sunbeam Countdown
- **Custom Sunbeam countdown**: Allows changing the position and scale of the countdown message. Default settings prevent clipping with pinned recipes.

### Rotatable Ladders
- **Rotatable ladders**. (<span style="color: red;">Known issue</span>: no cleanup for ladders that no longer exist. The only cleanup it performs is when a ladder is set back to its default rotation. It should also be rewritten to allow rotation while building.)
