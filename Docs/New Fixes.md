- **Cyclops power percentage clamp**: Fixes an underflow (very low negative number) when no cells are inserted.
- **Force engine shutdown**: Automatically shuts down the Cyclops engine when the power is off.
- **No invisible Cyclops buttons**: Disables the Cyclops helm buttons when the power is off, preventing them from being clickable while hidden.
