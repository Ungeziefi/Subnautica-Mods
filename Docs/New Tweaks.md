### <span style="color: green;">Done</span>
- **Critter size randomizer**: Randomizes the size of Cave Crawlers, Lava Larvas, Bleeders, Rockgrubs, Blighters, and Floaters. (I didn't like how [Random Creature Size](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/138) affects all creatures.)
- **Harvesting requirements**: Harvesting plants requires tools.
- **No obstacle check when sitting**: Allows sitting even if there's an object in the way.
- **No bundled batteries**: Tools and vehicles don't include batteries. Has 2 settings: one that covers only vanilla recipes, and another that is applied on all recipes in case you are using custom recipes that make it consistent. (Inspired by [Deathrun](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/1495).)
- **No floodlights on build**: Stops the floodlights from being defaulted to on when a Cyclops is built.
- **Auto-close Bulkhead doors**: Automatically closes bulkhead doors when a leak starts in a base. (Couldn't figure out how to animate them shut, so it's instant.)
#### Minor Tweaks
- **From "Use Trashcan" to "Use Trash can"**: Adds a missing space to the Trashcan prompt for consistency with its recipe name.
- **Capitalize "Use"**: Capitalizes the "Use" prompt for consistency with other prompts.
