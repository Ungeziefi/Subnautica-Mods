### <span style="color: green;">Done</span>
- **Creature size randomizer**: Randomizes the size of Cave Crawlers, Lava Larvas, Bleeders, Rockgrubs, Blighters, and Floaters. (I didn't like how [Random Creature Size](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/138) affects all creatures.)
- **Harvesting requirements**: Harvesting plants requires tools.
- **No obstacle check when sitting**: Allows sitting even if there's an object in the way.
- **No bundled batteries**: Tools and vehicles don't include batteries. (Inspired by [Deathrun](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/1495).)
#### Minor Tweaks
- **From "Use Trashcan" to "Use Trash can"**: Adds a missing space to the Trashcan prompt for consistency with its recipe name.
- **Capitalize "Use"**: Capitalizes the "Use" prompt for consistency with other prompts.
