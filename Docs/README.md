A collection of fixes, tweaks, and new features for Subnautica 2.0. The Fixes and Tweaks modules are a complete rework of [Tweaks and Fixes](https://github.com/qqqbbb/Tweaks-and-Fixes). Every single change is configurable and optimized for compatibility, avoiding the use of bool Prefixes whenever possible. The code is also more readable and organized.

You can find complete documentation in the [Docs folder](https://github.com/Ungeziefi/Subnautica-Mods/tree/main/Docs).

<small>**Disclaimer**: None of the T&F code was a direct copy, assuming the feature isn't simple to the point it can't be implemented any differently.</small>

Built with [Subnautica.Templates](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Subnautica.Templates) and [Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/).
