### <span style="color: green;">Done</span>
- **Cyclops power percentage clamp**: Fixes an underflow (very low negative number) when no cells are inserted.
- **Force engine shutdown**: Automatically shuts down the Cyclops engine when the power is off.
- **Cyclops helm HUD fixes**: Turns off the helm HUD when the power is off and prevents its buttons from being clickable while invisible.
- **Delay Aurora reply**: Prevents the Aurora reply from being received before sending the distress signal.

### <span style="color: orange;">To-Do</span>
- "When you have a HUD beacon for a location from a radio message (like lifepod 3), and get close to the location, the HUD beacon automatically turns off, but it's still shown as toggled on in the Beacon Manager in your PDA, so the HUD beacon is in a weird state where it's turned on in the PDA but still not visible. If you do nothing, save and quit, and come back later, it's properly turned off in the Beacon Manager."
- "When you're in the Enforcement Platform, the music track called "Ancient Aliens" on the soundtrack starts to play, but cuts off after a few seconds."
- **Cyclops HUD alpha sorting**: Fixes certain objects (like the Lost River waterfalls) incorrectly rendering in front of the Cyclops HUD.
