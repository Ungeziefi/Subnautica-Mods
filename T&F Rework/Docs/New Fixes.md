- **Force engine shutdown**: Automatically shuts down the Cyclops engine when the power is off.
- **Delay Aurora reply**: Prevents the Aurora reply from being received before sending the distress signal.
- **Oxygen Pipes across sub-biomes**: Allows Oxygen Pipes to be placed across sub-biomes such as caves or plateaus.
- **Disable ghost helm buttons**: Disables the invisible (but still clickable) Cyclops helm HUD buttons when the HUD is off.
