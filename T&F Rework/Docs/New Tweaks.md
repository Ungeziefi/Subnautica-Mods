- **Creature size randomizer**: Randomizes the size of a configurable list of creatures between an also configurable range. (I didn't like how [Random Creature Size](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/138) affects all creatures.)
- **No obstacle check when sitting**: Allows sitting even if there's an object in the way.
- **No bundled batteries**: Tools and vehicles don't include batteries. Has 2 settings: one that covers only vanilla recipes, and another that is applied on all recipes in case you are using custom recipes that make it consistent. (Inspired by [Deathrun](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/1495).)
- **No floodlights on build**: Stops the floodlights from being defaulted to on when a Cyclops is built.
- **Escape closes PDA**.
#### Miscellaneous
- **From "Use Trashcan" to "Use Trash can"**: Adds a missing space to the Trashcan prompt for consistency with its recipe name.
- **Capitalize "Use"**: Capitalizes the "Use" prompt for consistency with other prompts.
